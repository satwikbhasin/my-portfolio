## Overview

As a Teaching Assistant at SUNY Albany, I designed Evalutron to help streamline the grading process for university assignments. The repetitive and monotonous nature of grading can be time-consuming and tedious. Evalutron is an AI-powered autograder that grades student submissions based on a provided rubric and offers constructive feedback.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**

  - React
  - Next.js
  - Tailwind CSS
  - NextUI

- **Backend:**

  - Node.js
  - OpenAI API
  - Vercel's Lambda Functions

## How it Works

### 1. User Authentication

Users authenticate using a PIN to access the application. **If you wish to take a demo, please reach out :)**

### 2. File Upload

Users upload the assignment questionnaire, grading rubric, and student submission in PDF format.

### 3. Grading Process

- The uploaded files are sent to the OpenAI API for processing.
- **Prompt Engineering:** The AI is guided using carefully crafted prompts to evaluate the submissions based on the provided rubric.
- The AI evaluates the submission based on the provided rubric and generates grades and feedback.

### 4. Results Compilation

- The results, including grades & feedback, are compiled into an organized format.
- Users can download the results in CSV format for easy integration into Excel.
