## Overview

As a Teaching Assistant at SUNY Albany, I designed Evalutron to help streamline the grading process for university assignments. The repetitive and monotonic nature of grading can be time-consuming and tedious. Evalutron is an AI-powered autograder that grades student submissions based on a provided rubric and offers constructive feedback.
