## Overview

This is a comprehensive web application developed to enhance my skills in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project was built during my Software Engineering class (ICSI 518) at SUNY Albany, where I started my web development journey. It showcases the integration of frontend and backend technologies to create a full-stack application.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React.js**: Used to build the user interface, manage state, handle user interactions, and update the UI in real-time.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: Used to create the server, handle asynchronous operations, manage processes, and interact with the database.
- **Express.js**: Built on top of Node.js to manage routing, handle APIs, and integrate middleware.

### Database

- **MongoDB**: Used for data storage and retrieval.

### Deployment

- **Render**: Currently hosted on Render. Previously deployed on Amazon EC2.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application to ensure consistency across different environments and simplify deployment.

## Note

As this deployment is free, the backend servers automatically spin down
when not in use. Consequently, there may be a brief delay in fetching response
from backend such as retrieving products but the servers start back up upon
receiving a request.
