### Frontend

The frontend is built with React, utilizing Create React App for scaffolding. Styling is achieved with Emotion Styled Components and Material-UI for a modern look and feel.

### Backend

The backend is powered by Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It handles user authentication, data persistence in SQLite, and serves the RESTful API endpoints for the frontend.

### Deployment

- The frontend of the application is hosted on AWS S3 with CloudFront as the CDN. This setup ensures fast and reliable access to the application worldwide.
- The backend is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. This provides a scalable and reliable server environment for handling the application's backend services, including user authentication, data persistence, and serving RESTful API endpoints.

## Detailed Key Features

### Dashboard Synchronization / Real-time Updates

The Dashboard component ensures seamless synchronization every time a todo item is created, updated, or deleted. The `NewTodo` and `UpdateTodo` components handle these changes and invoke callback functions like `refreshAllTodos` and `refreshStats`. These functions use refs to trigger a rerender in the `AllTodos` and `TodoStats` components, ensuring the Dashboard always displays the most current data for a dynamic and responsive user experience.

### Light & Dark Mode

Users can switch between light and dark themes to suit their preference, enhancing the usability and visual appeal of the application. The design is scalable, allowing for the addition of numerous themes in the future.

### User Authentication

Secure login and registration functionality to keep your todos private. The application uses token-based
authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access their todos.

### Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Todos

Full management of your todo tasks. Users can create new todos, view all their existing todos, update the details of their todos, and delete todos they no longer need. The CRUD operations are implemented with RESTful API endpoints, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.

### Searching

Easily find tasks by searching any keyword from the todo task. The search functionality allows users to quickly locate
specific todos by entering relevant keywords, improving the usability and efficiency of the application.

### Responsive Design

A user-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The responsive design ensures that users can manage their todos comfortably, regardless of the device they are using.

### Statistics

The application includes features for displaying statistics related to the user's todos. This helps users track their productivity and manage their tasks more effectively.

### Error Handling and Validation

Robust error handling and validation mechanisms ensure that the application operates smoothly. Users receive clear feedback in case of errors or invalid input, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Project Architecture

The project is structured into two main parts: a backend and a frontend.

### Backend

The backend is built with Django, a high-level Python web framework. It is structured into a main project directory (todoproject) and two applications: todos and users.

- #### todoproject

  This directory contains settings and configurations for the entire Django project, including database configurations, application settings, and URL routing for the project level.

- #### todos

  This application handles the creation, modification, and deletion of todo items. It includes models for defining the data structure, views for handling HTTP requests, serializers for JSON serialization of the todo items, and URLs for routing.

- #### users

  This application manages user authentication, registration, and user-specific data. Similar to todos, it includes models, views, serializers, and URLs for handling user-related functionalities.

The backend uses Django's ORM for database interactions, with SQLite. Authentication is handled through Django Rest Framework for token-based authentication.

### Frontend

The frontend is a React application created with Create React App. It is structured into components, contexts, and
utility functions.

- #### Components

  The UI is broken down into reusable components (Authentication, Dashboard, etc.), which are organized under the `src/components` directory. These components interact with the backend through HTTP requests to display and modify data.

- #### Contexts

  Authentication state is managed globally using React Context (`AuthContext`). This context maintains the authentication state (`isLoggedIn`, `currentUser`, etc.) and provides functions (`login`, `logout`, `signup`) to modify this state.

- #### Utilities

  Utility functions, such as those for handling cookies (`cookies.js`), for managing todos (`todos.js`) are used to decouple the methods from components.

### Authentication Flow

- #### Login/Signup

  The user interacts with the `Authentication` component to log in or sign up. Upon successful authentication, the backend responds with a token (assuming token-based authentication) which is then stored in the browser in the cookies.

- #### Storing Authentication State

  The `AuthContext` maintains the authentication state across the application. It uses the token to make authenticated requests and to determine if the user is logged in.

- #### Making Authenticated Calls

  When the frontend needs to make an authenticated call to the backend (e.g., fetching todos), it includes the authentication token in the request headers. This token is retrieved from cookies and included in HTTP requests.

### Environment Variables

The frontend uses environment variables (e.g., `REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL`) to configure the backend URL, which is
essential for making API calls to the correct server.

### Routing

The frontend uses React Router for navigation between different components (Dashboard, Authentication, NotFound), with
routes defined in `AppRouter.jsx`. Access to certain routes is controlled based on the authentication state,
redirecting users to the appropriate component based on whether they are logged in.

## Deployment Process

### Backend

1. **Deploy on EC2**: Pulled the latest version of the backend code from the Git repository to an AWS EC2 instance.

2. **Run Django Server with Gunicorn**: Used Gunicorn to serve the Django application in the background using `&`. This can be done with a command like:

   ```bash
   gunicorn --workers 3 todoproject.wsgi:application &
   ```

3. **Set Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**:

- Configured Nginx to forward requests to the Gunicorn server. This provides an additional layer of security and handles static files.
- Example Nginx configuration:

  ```nginx
  server {
  listen 80;
  server_name ec2-18-205-27-184.compute-1.amazonaws.com;

  location / {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }

  location /static/ {
  alias /path/to/static/;
  }

  location /media/ {
  alias /path/to/media/;
  }
  }
  ```

### Frontend

1. **Build the React App**:
   Created a production build of the React application locally using `npm run build`.

2. **Upload to S3**:
   Uploaded the build directory to an AWS S3 bucket configured to host static websites.

3. **Set Up CloudFront**:

- Configured CloudFront to use the S3 bucket as the origin.
- Rewrited redirection rules for the bucket to handle client-side routing properly.

## Future Enhancements

When I start a project, I always develop keeping its future in mind. For this one, Below are some ideas I have in mind.

### Customizable Themes

Expand the theme options beyond light and dark mode to include customizable color schemes. Allow users to personalize their interface according to their preferences.

### Collaborative Features

Introduce collaboration capabilities where users can share and work on todos together with team members or collaborators. This could include real-time updates and shared task lists.

### Notification System

Implement a notification system to alert users about upcoming deadlines, completed tasks, or changes made by collaborators. Integration with push notifications can enhance user engagement and productivity.

### Integration with Calendar Services

Enable synchronization with popular calendar services (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook) to automatically populate tasks and deadlines into users' calendars. This integration simplifies planning and time management.

### Advanced Analytics

Enhance the statistics and analytics section with predictive analytics and data visualization. Provide insights into
task completion rates, productivity trends, and suggestions for optimizing task management.

### Offline Access

Further enhance the PWA capabilities by enabling offline access to todos. Implement offline storage and
synchronization so users can continue managing tasks even without an internet connection.

### Task Dependencies and Reminders

Introduce features for setting task dependencies and reminders. Allow users to create sequential tasks that automatically update based on completion status and send reminders for upcoming deadlines.

### Voice Command Integration

Incorporate voice command capabilities for hands-free task management. Users can add, update, or delete todos using voice commands, enhancing accessibility and convenience.
