## Overview

This website leverages the Truecaller API to fetch details for phone numbers provided in a CSV file and generates a PDF report with the results.

You can get an API key from RapidAPI [here](https://rapidapi.com/DataCrawler/api/truecaller4). Please note that the API is rate-limited to 20 requests per minute which means your csv file should not contain more than 20 phone numbers.

## Features

- Upload a CSV file containing phone numbers.
- Fetch details for each phone number using the Truecaller API.
- Generate a PDF report with the fetched details.
- Supports different regions and secret keys for API access.
