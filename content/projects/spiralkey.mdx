## Overview

**SpiralKey** is a web application developed as part of my Cryptography class (ICSI 526) at SUNY Albany. It is a user-friendly tool that encrypts and decrypts text using the robustness of symmetric key encryption combined with the captivating properties of spiral matrices. This dual-layer approach ensures both security and intrigue.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js + JavaScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern Design**: SpiralKey features a modern and intuitive user interface.
- **Browser-Based**: All encryption and decryption processes happen entirely in the browser, ensuring that no data is sent to a backend server.

## How It Works

### Encryption

- Go to the encryption tab.
- Enter your plaintext message.
- The app shows you the process of conversion and generates the ciphertext.
- You can then send the ciphertext to someone.

### Decryption

- The recipient goes to the decryption tab.
- They paste the received ciphertext.
- The app processes the ciphertext and reveals the original plaintext message.

## Encryption Mechanism

### Part 1 - Symmetric Key Encryption

- **Step 1**: The plaintext message is first encrypted using a symmetric key algorithm (AES). This process ensures confidentiality and authenticity.

- **Step 2**: The resulting ciphertext becomes the input for the next layer of encryption.

### Part 2 - Spiral Matrix Encryption

- **Step 3**: The ciphertext is divided into manageable blocks.

- **Step 4**: These blocks are arranged in a square matrix following a spiral pattern.

- **Step 5**: Sub-matrices are formed from this arrangement.

- **Step 6**: The column-wise bits of these sub-matrices contribute to the final encrypted binary string.

## Decryption Mechanism

- **Step 1**: Reconstruct the square matrix from the encrypted binary string using the spiral pattern.

- **Step 2**: Extract bits from the matrix (from most significant bit to least significant bit) to obtain the decrypted binary string.

- **Step 3**: Regenerate the original ciphertext.

- **Step 4**: Decrypt the ciphertext using the same symmetric key.
