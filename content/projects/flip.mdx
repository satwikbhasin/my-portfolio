### Overview
FLIP is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to bet on the flip of a coin. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it ensures transparency and fairness in every bet.

### Features
- **Decentralized Betting:** Place bets on a simple coin flip with full transparency ensured by Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Secure and Fair:** Leveraging blockchain technology, every bet outcome is verifiable and immutable.

### Smart Contract Deployment
The smart contract that powers FLIP is located in the "Smart Contract" folder. Follow the steps below to compile and deploy it on a local Ethereum network using Truffle and Ganache:

1. **Compile the Smart Contract:**
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

2. **Deploy the Smart Contract:**
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)

### Setting Up Environment Variables
After deploying the smart contract, you'll need to create a local .env file in the root directory of this project so that our frontend can interact with our smart contract. Follow these steps:

- After running truffle migrate, note the contract address from the output. It will look something like:
      ```bash
      0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
      ```

- In the root directory of your project, create a file named .env.

- Add the Contract Address to the .env File:
      ```bash
      NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345670
      ```

   - Replace the placeholder address with the actual address from the deployment output.

By following these steps, you'll have the FLIP smart contract deployed on your local Ethereum network and properly configured for use in your frontend application. Happy betting!
